\section{Introduction} \label{man-introduction}
This section will go in detail about the workings, idea's and logic of our expert system.

\section{Application} \label{man-application}
We have chosen to create an application that identifies the vehicle type based on user input.

By answering specific questions that the expert system asks,
the system is able to deduce and identify the type of a vehicle.
An example of a vehicle type defined in our system is `land vehicle'.
A land vehicle, like other vehicle types in our system, also consists
of subtypes. Subtypes of land vehicles are cars and bicycles in our system.

By answering `yes' or `no' to certain questions,
the system is able to make an educated
guess about the type of the vehicle.

\section{Usage} \label{man-usage}
The application is run by providing the following command \textbf{isVehicle(X)}.
This will first check if we are looking to identify a vehicle.

If the user types `yes' the system agrees on a abstract data type `vehicle'.
This data type has multiple subtypes such as `land vehicle' or `air vehicle'.
At last we have the `unidentified vehicle'; this can be a car or boat.
The answer the system gives will be decided by the answers that the user provides.

\section{Logic} \label{man-logic}
We make a lot of use of the modus ponens.

If the vehicle fly's it is a air vehicle.
If the vehicle drives and has 4 wheels is s a car.

Based on those fact's and question we can make certain assertions.

This follows the rule of modus ponens.

A
A -> B
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
:. B 

The modus ponens concept is reflected in the application with terain type vehicles.

If the vehicle drives on land it is an land vehicle.

The way modus pones applies here will be illustrated with a literal truth table.

The modus pones truth table is as following.
A B | A -> B
T T | T
T F | T
F T | F
F F | T

So a could a a vehicle
and B could be a ground bike
A B | A -> B
T T | A ground vehicle is a vehicle      = true
T F | A fround vehicle is not a bike     = true 
F T | Not a ground vehicle is a bike     = false
F F | Not a ground vehicle is not a bike = true

We also make use of the chain rule.
A vehicle is a ground vehicle is a bike.
vehicle is a bike.
