We created an expert system that indentify the type of vehicle based on questions.

We tested the application in the web version.

The application can be run by typing vehicle(X).
The expert programe will then ask a series of questions and then identifies the vehicle based on the user input.


The rules are defined below.
We make a lot of use of the modus ponens.

If the vehicle fly's it is a air vehicle.
If the vehicle drives and has 4 wheels is s a car.

Based on those fact's and question we can make certain assertions.

This follows the rule of modus ponens.

A
A -> B
________
:. B 

The modus ponens concept is reflected in the application with terain type vehicles.

If the vehicle drives on land it is an land vehicle.

The way modus pones applies here will be illustrated with a literal truth table.

The modus pones truth table is as following.
A B | A -> B
T T | T
T F | T
F T | F
F F | T

So a could a a vehicle
and B could be a ground bike
A B | A -> B
T T | A ground vehicle is a vehicle      = true
T F | A fround vehicle is not a bike     = true 
F T | Not a ground vehicle is a bike     = false
F F | Not a ground vehicle is not a bike = true

We also make use of the chain rule.
A vehicle is a ground vehicle is a bike.
vehicle is a bike.
