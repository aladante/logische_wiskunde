We created an expert system that indentify the type of vehicle based on questions.

We tested the application in the web version.

The application can be run by typing vehicle(X).
The expert programe will then ask a series of questions and then identifies the vehicle based on the user input.


The rules are defined below.
We make a lot of use of the modus ponens.

If the vehicle fly's it is a air vehicle.
If the vehicle drives and has 4 wheels is s a car.

Based on those fact's and question we can make certain assertions.

This follows the rule of modus ponens.

A
A -> B
________
:. B 

This concept is seen in our programe as if it has wings and fly's in the air it is an aircraft.


vehicle(airplane)  :- is_true('has wings'), air_vehicle() .
vehicle(spaceCraft)  :- is_true('has wings'), is_true('has no wheels'), air_vehicle().
vehicle(car)  :- is_true('has four wheels'), is_true('has enginge'), land_vehicle() .
vehicle(bike) :- is_true('has two wheels'), land_vehicle().
vehicle(cycle) :- is_true('has two wheels'), is_true('no engine'), land_vehicle().
vehicle(boat) :- is_true('has two wheels'), is_true('no engine'), boat_vehicle().

land_vehicle() :-
	is_true('drives on land'), 

air_vehicle() :-
	is_true('fly in air'), 
	is_true('has engine').

boat_vechicle() :-
	is_true("moves over water"),
    is_true("has no wheels")

is_true(Q) :-
        format("~w?\n", [Q]),
        read(yes).
