\section{Introduction} \label{man-introduction}
This section will go into detail about the working of the system.
We created an application that is able to do RSA encryption and decryption
of text messages.

\section{Application} \label{man-application}
This section will provide information about the setup of the program.
The user of the application needs to make sure there are no extra spaces
in their input in order to get correct results.

The user also needs to be aware that the calculation of P and Q could
take some time based on the value of N.
This also applies to decryption because P and Q aren't know beforehand
when E and N are provided. For this reason decryption can take some time also.

\subsection{Run}
The application can be run by double clicking it.

\section{RSA}
The RSA class in our application has multiple variables relevant to the
RSA encryption and decryption process which will be looked at below.

Some note worthy variables are INIT\_NUMBER, this will initialize
the first prime that will be used to calculate P and Q.

\begin{lstlisting}{}
private Random rand = new Random();
public static final BigInteger INIT_NUMBER = new BigInteger("2");
private final static BigInteger one = new BigInteger("1");
private String calculateTime;
private BigInteger p, q, n, e, d, phi;
\end{lstlisting}

We've chosen to use Big Interger for the provided methods which comes with the Math package.
Such methods are modPow, probablePrime and isProbablePrime.

To generate P and Q we use the method calculatePAndQ based on the input N.
This method is listed below.

\begin{lstlisting}
public void calculatePandQ(String nInput) {
    this.n = new BigInteger(nInput);
    long begin = System.currentTimeMillis();
    //Initialise n and p
    BigInteger p = INIT_NUMBER;
    //For each prime p
    while (p.compareTo(n.divide(INIT_NUMBER)) <= 0) {
        //If we find p
        if (n.mod(p).equals(BigInteger.ZERO)) {
            //Calculate q
            BigInteger q = n.divide(p);
            //Displays the result
            this.p = p;
            this.q = q;
            calculateTime = String.valueOf(System.currentTimeMillis() - begin);
            //The end of the algorithm
            return;
        }
        //p = the next prime number
        p = p.nextProbablePrime();
    }
    calculateTime = "No solution exists";
}
\end{lstlisting}

Using those steps P and Q are generated.

\subsubsection{Generate E}
To generate E we first calculate phi, then we loop and generate an E untill E is
less than phi and co-prime to phi.

The code for these calculations is as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
phi = p.subtract(one).multiply(q.subtract(one));
do {
    e = new BigInteger(phi.bitLength(), rand);
} while (e.compareTo(one) <= 0 || e.compareTo(phi) >= 0 || !e.gcd(phi).equals(one));
d = e.modInverse(phi);
\end{lstlisting}{}

\subsection{encryption}
To encrypt the message we first split the string in a char array.
Every char will be cast to an integer value and that value will be encrypted.
The cipherText will split each char by a comma.

\begin{lstlisting}
String cipherText = "";
ArrayList<Integer> convert = convertString(message);
for(Integer i : convert){
    cipherText =cipherText + BigInteger.valueOf(i).modPow(e, n) + ",";
}
return cipherText;
\end{lstlisting}{}

\subsection{Decryption}
Decryption requires an e and N and the encrypted text c as input.
P and Q are calculated based on the N the user has entered.
Then D will be calculated with the provided input and the calculated P and Q.

\begin{lstlisting}
e = new BigInteger(inputE);
calculatePandQ(inputN);
d = e.modInverse(phi);
\end{lstlisting}{}

\subsubsection{Step 2}
In the first step we will generate a private key, in the final step we will use this private key to decode the cipher.

Finally every char will BigInteger will be cast to a int which will translate to
the original message.

By making use of the stream method we can convert the whole array to the original message.

\begin{lstlisting}
public String decodeCipher(String cipherText) {
    String[] cipherArray = cipherText.split(",");
    ArrayList<Character> mess = new ArrayList<>();
    for(String c : cipherArray){
        BigInteger letter = new BigInteger(c).modPow(d, n);
        mess.add((char)letter.intValue());
    }
    return  mess.stream().map(e->e.toString()).reduce((acc, e) -> acc  + e).get();
}
\end{lstlisting}

Below are listed some pictures that show how our
application implements the encryption and decryption
process. An N and a message are entered and output
is generated.
