Hey there reader,

This is almost done.
But there are some issues i would like to adress.
I made use of simple funtions to generate a random prime to be aplied for q and p.
Even the assigment said we got extra points for implementing Big Integer.

But this does feel a bit easy, cheating, playing by the edges of the defined rules.
But still between the rules.

Sorry if this is made not the way you intended.
But i would like to refer to a quote by bill gates.

 “I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.”
    ~bill gates (https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/568877-i-choose-a-lazy-person-to-do-a-hard-job)

I am a lazy person who still understands the essence.
And this seems like a perfect solution.
